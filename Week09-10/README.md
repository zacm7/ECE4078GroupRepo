# Checkpoint 2: Integrated System (trial run for final demo)

---
## Introduction
Checkpoint 2 is the integration of all the modules you completed in the previous milestones. Integrate your work from C1, M1 to M3 so that the robot can create a map of the arena containing the estimated poses of 10 ArUco markers ([M1: SLAM](../Week02-04/)), 10 objects ([M2: CV](../Week05-06/)), and then perform the grocery shopping task ([M3: navigation](../Week07-08/)). The procedure will be very similar (if not identical) to your final demo, so make sure to ask a lot of questions this week! 

This folder and README will be populated during the semester.
